	Brief about myself
</h3>	
	
<p style="font-family:lato;">
	
	I was born and brought up in Gurgaon and am presently working as Software Engineer in Bangalore. <br> <br>

	I joined the organization 3 years ago. <br><br>

	During short span of my career I have a learnt and experienced a lot and hope to continue with the same zeal in future also.<br><br>

	I have always been a continuous learner and have an inclination for technology. <br><br>

	To continue in the same tradition, I have joined BITS Pilani WILP (Work Integrated Learning Programmes).<br><br>

	I strongly believe that <i><b> MTech Software Engineering </i></b> programme curriculum will improve my technical capabilities helping me to acquire new skills. <br><br>

	Also, having a qualification from prestigious institution as <b>BITS</b> is an added asset. <br><br>

	Having a strong backing of high-quality technical qualification will provide an edge and advantage to my career at this stage. <br><br>

	<i><b> MTech Software Engineering </b></i> will enhance scope for acquiring the technical education without leaving my Job. <br><br>

	This course will be stepping-stone for further growth of my career. This will expand my learnings, knowledge, and skills. <br><br>

	<b> I feel proud for this association with esteemed institution as BITS which will help me to realize and fulfill my dreams.</b> <br><br>
